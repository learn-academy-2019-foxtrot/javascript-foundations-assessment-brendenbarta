var text = 'outside'
function logIt(){
  console.log(text)
  var text = 'inside'

4. What does are the 5 HTTP verbs?

  Your answer:HTTP is a set of  methods to indicate the desired action to be performed.

In HTTP’s terms, verbs are called “request methods”, and they determine how the server should respond to a particular request. They mean that, if a URL defines a resource (a blog post, for example, or an image), different actions can be performed on that resource without needing to create different URLs or pass different types of request data.

  Researched answer:

6. STRETCH: What is a closure, what is it good for and how do you recognize one?

  Your answer: I am not sure

  Researched answer:A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment). In other words, a closure gives you access to an outer function’s scope from an inner function. In JavaScript, closures are created every time a function is created, at function creation time.


7. STRETCH: What is an API?

  Your answer: APIs allow applications to communicate with one another.

  Researched answer:An API is a set of definitions and protocols for building and integrating application software. API stands for application programming interface.

APIs let your product or service communicate with other products and services without having to know how they’re implemented. This can simplify app development, saving time and money. When you’re designing new tools and products—or managing existing ones—APIs give you flexibility; simplify design, administration, and use; and provide opportunities for innovation.
